    <p>Make this mackerel and leek hash in just 30 minutes. It uses just a few ingredients and can be served in the pan, so makes a great choice on busy weeknights</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g new potatoes , halved</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>2 large leeks , thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>100g peppered smoked mackerel , skin removed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp creamed horseradish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the potatoes in a microwaveable bowl with a splash of water, cover, then cook on high for 5 mins until tender (or steam or simmer them).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the leeks with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 mins, stirring so they donâ€™t stick, until softened. Tip in the potatoes, turn up the heat and fry for a couple of mins to crisp them up a bit. Flake through the mackerel.</li>
        <li>Make four indents in the leek mixture in the pan, crack an egg into each, season, then cover the pan and cook for 6-8 mins until the whites have set and the yolks are runny. Serve the horseradish on the side, with the pan in the middle of the table.</li>
    </ol>
